# this is a python script used to access and manipulate the site for the online school, "Michigan Connections Academy"
#
# SET UP THE 'my_info.py' WITH YOUR INFORMATION, OR THIS WILL FAIL IMMEDIATELY
#
# It will (hopefully) be able to:
# - open a Chrome browser (headless or non)
# - access the connections website
# - sign in to the adult account
# - if today is a school day: fill in an "8" , if not, it fills in a "0"
# - retrieve if any assignments are marked for completion
# - if yes; send how many
# - if yes; mark them as completed
# - if yes and successful; send a verification that (number) of assignments has been successfully marked complete
# - exit script (or keep open depending on "my_info.py//keep_open")
